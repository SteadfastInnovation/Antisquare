To eliminate all squares, Antisquare tells you which font is appropriate to display a given character.

We are looking for volunteers! Here is our goal:
1) Database of mappings {character→suitable fonts for that character}
2) API to get the name of the suitable font from a character or string

Current usage example:
./compile.sh
./generate-database.sh 
ណ: KhmerOS.ttf 
ζ: DroidSans-Regular.ttf OpenSans-Regular.ttf 
ʢ: 
[...]
