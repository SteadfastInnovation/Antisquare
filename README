Do some of your users see white squares like "Ϳ" ?
Antisquare helps you avoid those squares by telling you which font is appropriate to display a given character (among the fonts you choose to embed).

Usage:
1) Put your fonts in the fonts directory
2) Run generate-database.sh 
3) Copy AntiSquareData.java and Antisquare.java to your app
3) In your app, call: new Antisquare().getSuitableFonts('ណ:')
4) Result: "KhmerOS.ttf"
