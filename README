Do some of your users see white squares like "Ϳ" ?
Antisquare helps you avoid those squares by telling you which font is appropriate to display a given character (among the fonts you choose to embed).

We are looking for volunteers! Here is our goal:
1) Database of mappings {character→suitable fonts for that character}
2) API to get the name of the suitable font from a character or string

Current usage example:
./compile.sh
./generate-database.sh 
ណ: KhmerOS.ttf 
ζ: DroidSans-Regular.ttf OpenSans-Regular.ttf 
ʢ: 
[...]
